# ESBot – Case Study Description for Software Testing Course

## Introduction to the ESBot Application

The ESBot application is designed as an AI-powered learning assistant that supports students throughout their individual learning process. It provides a structured conversational interface through which users can explore course-related topics, receive explanations, and actively practice their knowledge. Unlike generic chat systems, ESBot focuses on educational support by guiding users through learning content, generating exercises, and offering feedback on their responses.

A central aspect of ESBot is its ability to facilitate **interactive learning sessions**. Students can ask questions related to course material and receive contextualized explanations tailored to their needs. In addition, ESBot can generate practice questions and small quizzes, enabling users to test their understanding in a lightweight and iterative manner. This interaction model encourages active engagement rather than passive consumption of information.

Beyond simple question-answering, ESBot introduces **guided learning functionality**. The system supports users in deepening their understanding by offering follow-up explanations, examples, and clarification prompts. While the responses are generated using AI-based inference, the system is expected to structure interactions in a way that remains comprehensible and pedagogically useful.

Another important element is the handling of **learning sessions and progress context**. User interactions are stored in a persistent manner, allowing the system to maintain conversational continuity and provide a coherent learning experience over time. This enables students to revisit previous questions, track their progress, and continue learning without losing context.

From a technical perspective, ESBot is designed as a **three-tier architecture**, consisting of a frontend (user interface), a backend (application logic and API), and a data layer (persistent storage). AI inference is performed through external or locally hosted models (e.g., via Ollama, vLLM, or LM Studio), which are integrated into the backend as a dedicated service. This modular design ensures separation of concerns and supports extensibility as well as testability.

ESBot is intended as a **web-based application**, allowing access from various devices without requiring installation. The system is deliberately scoped to remain focused and lightweight, ensuring that students can use it without extensive onboarding while still benefiting from meaningful AI-assisted learning interactions.

Importantly, ESBot acknowledges the **non-deterministic nature of AI-generated responses**. Therefore, the system is designed to handle uncertainty by structuring outputs, validating responses where possible, and presenting results in a controlled and user-friendly manner.

Overall, ESBot serves as a practical and modern example of an AI-integrated system, combining conversational interfaces, modular architecture, and educational use cases. It is particularly suited for teaching software engineering and testing concepts, as it introduces realistic challenges such as external dependencies, probabilistic outputs, and system integration.

## High-Level Expectations

### 1. Learning-Centered Interaction
The system must support students in understanding and practicing course content through guided conversational interaction.

### 2. Structured AI Integration
AI-generated responses should be embedded in a controlled interaction flow, ensuring clarity and usability.

### 3. Persistence of Learning Context
User sessions and interactions should be stored to allow continuity and progress tracking.

### 4. Modular and Layered Architecture
The system must follow a clear separation between frontend, backend, data storage, and AI inference components.

### 5. Testability and Observability
The system must be designed in a way that enables comprehensive testing across all layers, including mocking of AI components.

## Minimal System Architecture

ESBot follows a minimal three-tier architecture:
- User Interface (UI) - Tier1
- Application Backend - Tier2
- Database - Tier3
- LLM Inference Engine  (optional)

The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the easy addition of new features and the replacement of existing components.

The architecture is designed to be testable, allowing for the testing of the system at multiple levels, including unit testing, integration testing, API testing, and system testing.
